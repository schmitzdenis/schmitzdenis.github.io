      <h1>Hello World !</h1>
      <p>
            Deeply convinced that most of the applications should be built using web technologies, i'm passionate about client, server and user-interface coding.
      </p>
      <p>
      I constantly seek improvements in security, performance, maintainability, design and ergonomy.
      </p>
      <p>
      I think nowadays you should be able to use your app regardless the device you access it with.I therefore grown skills in the hybrid and responsive app development field.
      </p>
      <p>
      My goal is to make forget the user he's using web by providing him right now the web technology he heard about yesterday.
